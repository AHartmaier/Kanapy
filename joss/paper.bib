title="DREAM.3D: A Digital Representation Environment for the Analysis of Microstructure in 3D",
journal="Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation",
year="2014",
month="Dec",
day="01",
volume="3",
number="1",
pages="56--72",
abstract="This paper presents a software environment for processing, segmenting, quantifying, representing and manipulating digital microstructure data. The paper discusses the approach to building a generalized representation strategy for digital microstructures and the barriers encountered when trying to integrate a set of existing software tools to create an expandable codebase.",
