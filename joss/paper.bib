abstract = {Crystallographic textures, as they develop for example during cold forming, can have a significant influence on the mechanical properties of metals, such as plastic anisotropy. Textures are typically characterized by a non-uniform distribution of crystallographic orientations that can be measured by diffraction experiments like electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Such experimental data usually contain a large number of data points, which must be significantly reduced to be used for numerical modeling. However, the challenge in such data reduction is to preserve the important characteristics of the experimental data, while reducing the volume and preserving the computational efficiency of the numerical model. For example, in micromechanical modeling, representative volume elements (RVEs) of the real microstructure are generated and the mechanical properties of these RVEs are studied by the crystal plasticity finite element method. In this work, a new method is developed for extracting a reduced set of orientations from EBSD data containing a large number of orientations. This approach is based on the established integer approximation method and it minimizes its shortcomings. Furthermore, the {\it L}${\sp 1}$ norm is applied as an error function; this is commonly used in texture analysis for quantitative assessment of the degree of approximation and can be used to control the convergence behavior. The method is tested on four experimental data sets to demonstrate its capabilities. This new method for the purposeful reduction of a set of orientations into equally weighted orientations is not only suitable for numerical simulation but also shows improvement in results in comparison with other available methods.},
